Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management tool with a focus on modern applications such as single-page applications, mobile applications, and REST APIs.

Single-Sign On:
--------------
Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications. This means that your applications don't have to deal with login forms, authenticating users, and storing users. Once logged-in to Keycloak, users don't have to login again to access a different application.

=>Installation of keycloak latest version
=>Run the server with bin/kc.bat start-dev
